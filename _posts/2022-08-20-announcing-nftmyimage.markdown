In collaboration with the Algorand Foundation, We are thrilled to announce the general launch of NFTMyImage - the fastest, cheapest, and easiest way to mint NFTs from any image.

# Why we created NFTMyImage

Does the world really need another NFT creator? Aren’t NFTs bad for the environment? Is it a scam? Why do I need an NFT when I can just have an image?

These are some of the questions that you might be asking. We asked them too. Ultimately, we fully acknowledge that mainstream use cases for NFTs have not been accepted yet (and no, it’s not a scam).

First, NFTMyImage is built on the Algorand blockchain. This allows us to have super low cost and low energy minting of NFTs. In fact, Algorand is the world’s only eco-friendly blockchain, minting an NFT uses no more electricity than using Google Chrome on your computer.

Historically, the NFT-related products that have made the news are primarily ways to buy and sell art or status - think OpenSea or BAYC. The frenzy of people trying to make a quick buck and the plethora of questionable (and sometimes illegal) activity created a mental block for many, us included. NFTMyImage was born out of a desire to really figure out if there is potential.

History teaches us that two things make technologies go mainstream and new use cases to be discovered quickly.
1. Cost
2. Ease of use

If we solve these two problems - it allows us to accelerate the exploration of the tree of possibilities that sprouts out of the seed of any new technology.

So, our purpose in building this product is to answer a simple yet powerful question - 
**“What happens when we make NFT minting free, instant, and as easy to use as Google?”**

We’re excited to find out the answer with you. To help with this, we’ve decided to make the first 10,000 NFTs minted **completely free of charge**.

Some use cases we’ve already heard about from our beta users **outside of the legacy digital art space** - 
1. Wedding photos as keepsakes and digital anniversary gifts
2. Conference attendee memorabilia
3. Academic content where first-to-publish matters
4. Internet memes where original authorship is disputed

# How it works

Hopefully we’ve made NFTMyImage.com so easy to use that you don’t even need this section. You upload an image, name your NFT, and voila - you have an NFT. 

For advanced users, you can transfer your freshly minted NFT to a wallet of your choosing that supports Algorand based NFTs - whether it’s via Pera Wallet or any others supported by WalletConnect.

For the nerds like us, you’ll appreciate that our images are stored on IPFS and the NFT payloads contain a hash of the image - which means that your NFTs cannot be spoofed - unlike some of the ahem art-based marketplaces ahem.
